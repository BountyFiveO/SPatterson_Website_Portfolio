  <h2>About Shawn</h2>
  <p>In April 2008, I enlisted in the US Army. I served 8 years of service and was honorably discharged. <br> Since
    becoming a civilian again I have gravitated more towards the tattoo industry. I have been a tattoo <br> artist
    for
    4 years now. But, my dream job was always to become a= Software Developer/Engineer.</p>
  <p> Becoming a student at <a href="https://thinkful.com" class="about-link">Thinkful</a> has really made
    my dream of
    becoming a
    software engineer a reality <br> instead of just some pipe dream. If you are reading checking out my portfolio
    and
    are in need of a very <br> motivated and self drivin developer/engineer, pleas don't hesitate to contact me. I
    would love to work with <br> other developers/engineers to create and develop the next best software!</p>
  <h3>Here are just a few reasons I love coding:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>I love to create things from nothing.</li>
    <li>Its always something different so its never boring!</li>
    <li>When you code something from start to finish and its
      <br> all working perfectly.. There is a huge sense of acomplishment.
    </li>
    <li>There are just so many reason to put down in this list..</li>
  </ol>
